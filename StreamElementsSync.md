# Instructions for TTSLabs 2.0.18 StreamElements integration:

When StreamElements integration is enabled, three things happen:

1. Media controls and some settings can be controlled directly from Streamlabs (by streamer and mods).
2. Those controls and settings are disabled in the app.
3. TTS is synced with on-screen alerts. TTS won't play until an alert appears on screen, and it will automatically apply all the donation filters that StreamElements normally would.
